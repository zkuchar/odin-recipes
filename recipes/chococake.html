        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                A moist chocolate cake that incorporates orange juice and extract into the batter and frosting for a nice citrusy flavor!
                <br>I have made adjustments to the recipe to make it vegan!
            </p>

                    <li>

            <h4>For the Chocolate orange cream cheese frosting:            </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        2½ cups Powdered sugar (approx 284 grams)

                    <li>8 tbsp vegan butter</li>
                    <li>
                        ½ cup Unsweetened cocoa powder (approx 50 grams)

                    <li>

                        </li>
                    <li>
                        ¼ tsp (1.17g) vanilla extract

                    <li>
                        ¼ tsp (1.17) of orange extract (optional but gives the frosting a little more pronounced orange flavour)
                        </li>
                    <li>
                        4 oz (113g) of vegan cream cheese at room temperature‐ can add a little more to suit taste and texture of frosting (approx half or ¾ of a regular pack)
                        </li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Grease two 9 inch round cake pans and line with parchment paper rounds, grease the parchment and then lightly dust with some cocoa powder
                    </li>
                <li>
                    In a large mixing bowl whisk all the dry ingredients together until everything is well incorporated.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Then add the eggs, milk, oil and extracts and beat with a mixer until everything is well incorporated approximately 2 minutes.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    In a small saucepan or in the microwave, heat the orange juice until just boiled and then pour it in the batter very slowly while you fold 
                    <br>and stir the batter by hand. Do this until it’s very well blended. It will be very liquid.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Divide batter evenly between both cake pans and bake for approx 35‐40 minutes until the centre is set and a toothpick tester comes out clean.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the oven and allow cakes to cool on cooling racks for 10‐15 minutes
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Run a knife around the edges of the cakes and invert onto cooking racks to cool completely. Peel off parchment paper when cooled. While cakes 
                    <br>cool make the frosting. In a large bowl cream the butter and sugar together with a mixer.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Then add the cocoa powder, hot orange juice and the extract, if using, and beat until well blended scraping sides of bowl as needed.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Beat in the cream cheese until smooth and whipped.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Refrigerate until firm so that it’s easier to spread
                    </li>
                <li>
                    To assemble, place one layer on a serving plate and then frost the top of the first layer, stack the second cake on top of the frosting gently 
                    <br>and then frost the top layer as well. You can leave it rustic like that with two thicker layers of frosting in between layers and on top or 
                    <br>you can spread the top layer of frosting bringing down the sides to evenly coat the sides. Either way is delicious.
                    </li>
                <li>
                    Refrigerate cake until ready to serve. Frosting gets very soft and gooey at room temperature, but is fabulously delicious. Decorate with candied 
                    <br>orange slices if you wish and sprinkle cake with shaved dark chocolate. Both of these are optional.
                    </li>
