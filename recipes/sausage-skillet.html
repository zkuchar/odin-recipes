        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Add the farro to a small saucepan and cover with at least 1 inch cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, 
                    <br>and cook until the grains are tender, about 15 to 18 minutes. Drain any excess water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the sausage from the plastic wrapper and thinly slice into rounds. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high 
                    <br>heat with 1 tbsp (2 tbsp) olive oil. Add the sliced sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and crispy, 
                    <br>about 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer the crispy sausage to a plate. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wipe the mushrooms with a damp towel to clean, and slice. Peel and mince the shallot. Mince the garlic. Dice the apple. 
                    <br>Return the skillet to medium-high heat with 2 tbsp (4 tbsp) olive oil. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until softened, 
                    <br>about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the minced shallot, minced garlic, diced apple, and a pinch of salt and pepper to the skillet and cook, 
                    <br>tossing occasionally, until the apple is caramelized in places, about 4 to 6 minutes. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the balsamic vinegar to the skillet and cook until it evaporates, about 30 seconds. Add the cooked farro, spinach, and 
                    <br>French mustard & herb blend and toss well. Cook until the spinach is wilted, about 3 to 4 minutes. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Top the skillet with the crispy sausage. Divide the apple & herbed sausage skillet between plates. Enjoy!
